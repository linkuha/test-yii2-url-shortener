## Yii 2 URL (links) shortener

Almost all changes with original basic project template you can see in the module named 'shorten'. Some changes also made in configuration files (separated to local and main as like in advanced template).

In principle, you can separate the module from the template, but I want to leave it entirely.

Working example of this project: [ss.pudich.ru](http://ss.pudich.ru) 

REQUIREMENTS
------------

The minimum requirement by this project template that your Web server supports PHP 5.4.0.
